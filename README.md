## Overview
The nCent Labs Hybrid Meta-Application is a simple tool that allows users to quickly spin up their own incentives-based challenge! Users can define a finished work product of some sort (i.e. an employee hire, the creation of a video, etc.), define the tasks required to achieve the end goal, and finally source the work by providing rewards and accepting work submissions!

## Installation & Usage
1. Install it using npm:
  ```shell
  npm i ncent-sandbox-sdk
  ```

2. require/import it in your JavaScript:
  ```js
  const nCentHybrid = require('ncent-meta-hybrid');
  ```

3. Run the Command-line Interface right out of your shell!
  ```shell
  node {path_to_your_node_modules_folder}/ncent-hybrid-meta/metaCLI.js
  ```
